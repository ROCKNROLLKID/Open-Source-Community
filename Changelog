Open-Source Community 2.1
February 11th, 2016:

- Introducing a new discussion topic. This topic allows users to view the different types of open-source licenses that you may use if you were ever to create your own program. Currently, not all licenses are posted. If you notice something missing, feel free to leave a comment or suggest a license to be added. The discussion topic can be found here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/opencommunity/discussions/0/412446890553037315/ 

- Introducing a new forum section. This forum section will allow programmers to communicate with eachother and will help anyone who is new to the programming world get started. Here programmers can help eachother, post tutorial videos or your own videos, even hire other programmers if you wanted to, and so much more. The section is a work in progress still, but you may view what is currently done here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/opencommunity/discussions/3/ 

- Edit the overview page to include a link for the open-source licenses topic. 

- Fixed many typos, spelling errors and grammar issues throughout OSC. 

- Our Github page has been updated for OSC 2.1 and now includes a changelog of all previous changes done to OSC overtime.


Open-Source Community 2.0
October 29th, 2015:

- Introducing a GitHub page, which was mentioned earlier this week. Here you can edit anything in the group and will be ported to the steam community. You can also edit the community logo their, as well. 

- Introducing a totally new job board and now includes some volunteer work oppertunities. The job board no longer divides individuals into different ranks. There will now only be 1 rank for staff members. There are also been more restirctions to joining the staff team. We now also include volunteer work and all credit to staff and volunteer work is still given in our contributor page. 

- We are sorry to inform everyone, but we have dropped support for translations. Some of the reasons are due to lack of translators and lack of staff members that speak different languages. The translations may come back in the distant future, but that has not yet been decided. 

- Introducing a remade overview page. We now include links to whereever you want to go to as well as a link for our GitHub page. 

- Introducing a totally new organization for our list of software/games. The list is now cataorgized into sections (such as games, operatig systems, security and privacy, etc), as requested by several members of the community. Please note that the list of software/games page will always update as new software/games are added to it.

- We have added a archive section for all old and solved topic discussions. You may find it in the discussion section as a fourm thread named "Archvies". We like to keep all memories of our community and you can view them anytime.
