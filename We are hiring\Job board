As our list grows, our community grows and expands, and as software updates more frequently, we will need more help to maintain each software/game. We have a few different job positions open for people plus some requirements to be able to join us. 

Job positions: 
- Open-Source Represenative 
- Tech Support 
- Group Manager 

Requirements: 
- You must know what open-source means and be able to explain it to us, in detail, when we do our interview. 
- You must be dedicate to the group and be willing to work when needed. 
- You must be willing to work with other people. 

Each job will be explained during an interview and you may decide which position you want, as long as the position is open. You do not need to decide right away which job you want.
