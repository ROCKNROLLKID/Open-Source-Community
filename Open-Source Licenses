If you're creating your own original programs, you automatically own the copyright to all of the source code that you have written. To make your program "open source" and let other people freely use your own code, it's not enough to just publish it. You have to give the people specific permissions under which they can use your code, and the easiest way to achieve this is by using one of these popular open source licenses to license your code.

What these licenses all have in common is that they adhere to the "[url=https://opensource.org/osd]Open Source Definition[/url]" as published by the Open Source Initiative. They have been reviewed by experienced lawyers multiple times throughout their lifetime, and are used by many big, popular, widely-used open source projects. Some of these licenses employ the practice of [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft]Copyleft[/url] to make sure derivatives of works can only be licensed under the same license. They are also called Copyleft Licenses; licenses not including this are usually called permissive licenses, because they permit the user to create proprietary derivative works.

Licenses emplyoing a form of copyleft:
[url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License]GNU General Public License (GPL)[/url]: This is the most popular copyleft license, which gained popularity because it is used by the GNU project for all of their works. It's especially pervasive in the GNU/Linux community, with even the Linux kernel being licensed under GPL. It is using a strong form of copyleft to ensure that the freedoms that users of GPL software have are preserved even for derivative works.

[url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License]GNU Library or "Lesser" General Public License (LGPL)[/url]: The little brother of the GPL uses a weaker form of copyleft, that permits integrating software licensed under LGPL into a proprietary program, but only if the LGPL-licensed part is still separately editable and exchangeable by the user. This is usually achieved by using the LGPL-licensed program as a shared library, hence the former name of the license.

Permissive licenses:
[url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License]MIT license[/url]: The MIT uses many different licenses for their software, but the most popular ones are called the "Expat License" and the "X11 License", named after popular software packages which are using them. MIT licensed code can be used in any program as long as copyright notices are preserved in the distribution.

[url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses]BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" license[/url]: There are many different BSD licenses, with the so-called 3-clause BSD license being one of the most popular. In this edition it is very similar to the Expat License, with only requiring preservation of copyright notices and warranty disclaimers. It also prohibits using the name of the copyright holder used in promotional material of derivated software.

[url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License]Apache License 2.0[/url]: This license, seemingly similar to the Expat and 3-clause BSD license, includes certain patent termination and indemnification provisions. This can be useful especially for software packages describing methods and algorithms that could be patented.
